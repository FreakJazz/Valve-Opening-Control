## Description

This work shows the open-loop control of the opening and closing of a globe valve by means of an adaptation of gears to a stepper motor, in addition to showing the opening percentage by means of an LCD and calibrating the setpoint by means of a potentiometer, the Flow shows the flow of water from the valve using an oscilloscope for opening and closing tests.

## Programming

In this section, the programming of the Arduino is observed to calibrate the steps and show both the setpoint and the valve opening on the LCD

### LiquidCrystal

In order to visualize the interface the LCD 16x2 is used.
